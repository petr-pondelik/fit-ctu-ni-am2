= Server-Sent Events

Simple implementation of NodeJs server supporting SSE with simple HTML/JS client.

== Prerequisites

    node v14.16.0+

== Implementation

=== Server

Server generates ConnectionID to identify connected client using current timestamp. +
Every second it feeds the client with 10 generated messages. +
Messages aren't shared across the multiple connections and each client has it's own message queue.

=== Client

Client is implemented within the `src/client.html` file. +
It opens a persistent connection to an HTTP server, which sends events in text/event-stream format. +
Incoming events are displayed as Bootstrap alerts.
