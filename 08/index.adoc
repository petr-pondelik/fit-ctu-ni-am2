== Implementation

=== HTTP/2 server

Application source is provided by simple HTTP/2 server. +
HTTP/2 server implementation is available within the `src/http2-server.js` file. +
The server always returns content of `src/public/index.html`.

=== Client-side application

Browser-based client-side application tries to fetch user's projects list.

If the request fails with `401 Unauthorized`, it redirects user to GitLab authorization page. +

When user is redirected back to `redirect_uri`, the application fetches access token and stores the token into session storage.

Stored access token is used for fetching the projects list until it's valid (until it the token expires or the token was revoked). +
If the access token is not valid, the application starts new authorization process.

Projects list is rendered using `renderProjectsCollection` function as Materialize collection.
